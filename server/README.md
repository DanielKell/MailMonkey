# MailMonkey

A full-stack web app for users to send surveys and collect feedback from clients. 
Create a simple survey and send it out to as many recipients via email as you like. 
Recipients can respond via their received email, and results are updated on the user's dashboard.
Every step is easy to use, as users can login via google OAuth and purchase credits with Stripe.
